    "## Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "I spent about 5-6 hours on this, scattered in chunks. Understanding the data was a little more tricky than I anticipated, given the number of indicators and the domain knowledge needed to interpret them. The World Bank website itself has a very good API and plotting package associated with it, so that I really didn't need much of this separate notebook. A lot of my analysis could have been done *in situ*. \n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up looking at countries that were **experiencing the highest levels of energy depletion**, defined as the ratio of the value of their current stock to remaining future reserves. I wanted to find the countries that had the highest rates (who are potentially facing near-term financial and energy crises) and see if this related to their likelihood of diversifying and investing in other areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Middle East & North Africa** as a region has the highest energy depletion rate (EDR) in the world (peaking as high as 20% of their gross national index, currently at around 10%). Within the region, there's significant diversity; small, currently oil-rich countries like Bahrain and Qatar have among the highest EDRs, while cultural and geographic outliers like Israel, Malta, and Morocco have among the lowest EDRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the countries in the region by EDR, I looked at their investment in three areas that would be more \"renewable\" and potentially profitable: tourism, research & development, and education. All countries with low EDR spend more of their gross national index in each of these areas; of the \"at-risk\" countries with high EDR, though, there wasn't any strong increase in these indices in the last five years (with a couple exceptions: Oman is increasing spending on education, and Qatar is getting more income from tourism). These aren't strong signs for the future of the citizens in these countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future work would be to explore this for the remainder of the countries in the dataset and to find historical trends of countries that had high EDRs and then re-invested in the development indicators above. That would be useful data to put into a training model and predict which of the countries in the Middle East & North Africa are capable of bucking the trend."

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity.

    "### Let's analyze the results of each of these, separated by major region. \n",

    "Net forest depletion is the product of the rents derived by harvesting timber and the excess amount of wood production over the growth rate in a given year. This is expressed in terms of **money**; a positive value means that a region could be receiving savings at the expense of decreasing their natural forest resources. In the last 45 years, both South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have had by far the highest amount of depletion (we'll look at individual countries later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Net mineral depletion is the ratio of the value of current mineral reserves over the remaining lifetime (*sidenote: I don't understand how this can be a monetary value unless it's looking at the value of the remaining lifetime, not the length. Metadata doesn't explain this sufficiently.*) The regions with the highest mineral depletion in the present are Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and East Asia & Pacific. There are some interesting commonalities among all regions; there was a global nadir around the year 2000, and then a significant rise with a sharp dip around 2008. I'd conjecture that this is related to the 2008 global recession. \n",
    "\n",
    "Net energy depletion is also the ratio of the current amount of resources to the remaining lifetime (*caveats still apply*), but covering coal, crude oil, and natural gas. The percentage of gross national income for energy over all regions is roughly a factor of 10 higher than for forest or mineral, reaching as high as 20%. In this case, the Middle East & North Africa dominate in every year out of the last 45. Trends are similar for all regions, including higher depletion in the 1970s and early 1980s and a similar sharp drop around 2008."

A couple of these countries are outliers with respect to the group; Malta is a Mediterranean island and a member of the EU/Eurozone, while Israel is the only Jewish-majority state and has famously strained relations with the majority of the other countries in this group. It's not as clear why Jordan and Morocco are much lower, but neither is a large oil producer or OPEC member."

    "There's a huge overall gap between the two classes; countries with the highest energy depletion have less than 15% of their GNI from tourism. For Qatar, it's rising sharply (with only a few years of data), which might indicate diversification in the face of a pending energy crisis. The development of Doha as an airline hub and rapidly expanding city would support that. \n",
